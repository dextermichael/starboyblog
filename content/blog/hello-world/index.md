As the Youth Pastor said “We will now have Dexter deliver his first sermon” I started to feel a nervousness like no other. This wasn’t this first time I felt this way, and it definitely wouldn’t be the last. I tend to look back at moments when I first begin something. Whether it was a new skill, relationship, or school. It always amazes how i feel the same anxiety each time. This time during my first sermon I had to muster something that I hadn't yet learned the word for.



I was a curious kid,If I didn't know something I'd ask.I would tell myself you might sound stupid for a second, but at least you wont be after. Anything that interested me I’d try. Not thinking for a moment that i couldn't find the ability to execute. Whether it was playing piano, singing, preaching or playing basketball there wasn't anything i couldnt do if I gave it my all. But this sermon was the first time I'd ever done something in front of hundreds of people.



After the Pastor announced my name I walked up to the pulpit. I felt every step I took. I looked out and saw more faces than I’d ever known. I was scared that I would mess up, stutter or forget something important. Yes, there were times I stuttered and forgot things I should have said. But I finished. I’m sharing this story because I often find myself coming back to this moment when I face a new challenge. I learned a lesson that day that still serves me.



When I walked down from the pulpit I sat next to my big sister and that hug kissed me. She said “ you were nervous huh?” I looked back at her with a “DUH” expression. She said to me “That was courage, You were afraid and did it anyway”. Everytime i try something new. I always think of how much courage this new thing will take. Nothing is too big or scary. It just might take a little bit more courage.
